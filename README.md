# Class_Object_review

Class is a Blue Print of a house. It contains details about of the house.
Based on details and descriptions, we can build a house == Object (name, grade...)
 Attributes: variables

Methods: functions
student1.function1()

While you can mannually assign attributes to object: student1.grade = 40
Use init method to do the same thing
init method is a special one, bc it is called everytime objects are created
student1 = Student('Tim', '95') 
init method is called such that 'Tim' is assigned to name, 95 is assigned to grade
